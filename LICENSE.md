Since the author of [PassIFox/ChromeIPass](https://github.com/pfn/passifox), which this implementation is based on, has not added a license to his project yet I will wait with including a license.
Once that is cleared up I will choose a compatible license (or in case it doesn't reimplement the library 'from scratch').
